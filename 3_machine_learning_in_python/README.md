# Preassignment 3

Before the first class, please complete the following 3 tasks. 

Completing the pre-assignment will ensure you have all of the software needed to follow along with the session that covers the Regression and Classsification in Python Lecture.

## Task 1: Install Anaconda3 with Jupyter Notebook

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python (and R) programming language for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform that combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations and more. We will use Jupyter Notebook throughout the lecture.

Please go to [Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) and follow the instructions to install Anaconda at your local machine.

## Task 2: Install Python Libraries

Please launch Anaconda, create a new Jupyter Notebook and add the `requirements.txt` in the same directory with the Notebook. Run the following command on a cell.

`!pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

The requirements.txt can be found on Github. Please take a screenshot of the outcome of this command.

## Task 3: Verify the installation

Now run the following command.

`import pandas, matplotlib, numpy, shap, missingno, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm, tpot`

Please take a screenshot after the execution of this command. If there is no output, then everything was imported without a problem.


See you in class!
