We had some data in Table~\ref{tab:good}. Now we would like to plot some random data.

% We put plots within another float environment called figure
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
% We can include graphics using a command from the graphicx package
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{plot.png}
\caption{Our beautiful plot}
% The tab: and fig: in the labels are by convention (not a rule)
\label{fig:plot}
