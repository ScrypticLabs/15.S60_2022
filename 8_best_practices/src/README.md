# src

This is where you keep code that needs to be of a *very high quality*, because it is intended to be multi-use.

This could be code that appears prominently in your project or which you intend to make publicly available as a tool for others to use. An outsider will browse this directory and be amazed by the quality of the modular code, the documentation, and the thorough unit tests.

Some examples of what to include in this directory:
- You are implementing a new optimization model or algorithm that is the central component of a paper.
- You have some code that you will make available as a package for others to use in Julia or Python.
- You have some code that is reused across all your scripts.
